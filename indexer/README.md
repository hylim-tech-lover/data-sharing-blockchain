# Private Blockchain Implementation MVP - Indexer

## Description

Blockchain data is sequential which makes it auditable but not easily readable in real-time. Therefore Indexer is a typical blockchain pre-processor implementation that parses data from blockchain into a traditional SQL/NoSQL database format for real-time query.

This allows enhanced features like block explorer to display complex data based off the blockchain without the computation cost.
